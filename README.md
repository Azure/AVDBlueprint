# Instructions for customizing and deploying Azure Virtual Desktop to your environment, utilizing Azure Blueprints  

## Overview

[Azure Blueprints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/blueprints/overview) provide a structured approach to standing up new environments, while adhering to environment requirements.  Microsoft has created a set of Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) Blueprint objects that help automate the creation of an entire environment, ready to run.  
Azure Blueprints utilize ["artifacts"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/blueprints/overview#blueprint-definition), such as:

* Role Assignments
* Policy Assignments
* Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates
* Resource Groups

The AVD Blueprints are meant to deploy an entire environment, including Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AAD DS), a management virtual machine (VM), networking, AVD infrastructure, and related resources, in a turn-key fashion.   The following is a guide to help accomplish customizing to your environment.  

## High Level steps to get started

* Meet pre-requisites in your Azure subscription.
* Download and edit the sample files in the folder "Examples and Samples".
* Edit the sample file **"assign_default.json"**.  This file is what makes the Blueprint unique to your environment.  You can specify a small number of parameters such as the required ones only.  The Blueprint has default values for many parameters.  Or you can override a parameter value of your preference.  An example might be Azure virtual machine size, or Windows Gallery image SKU.
Though you can also set and change parameters in the Azure Portal, there are a lot to set and some could be ambiguous.
* The easiest and fastest way to add this Blueprint definition is by using the sample file """import-bp.ps1"**.  Note that "import-bp.ps1" references another file "run.config.json". You can use "import-bp.ps1" as is, with no edits.  The changes needed to the "run.config.json" file are TenantID, SubscriptionID, Blueprint Name, Blueprint Path, Assignment file name and path.  It is possible to create this Blueprint using the Azure portal, but is difficult and has already been done here.
* Publish the Blueprint (This can be done automatically with the included sample file **"import-bp.ps1"**).
The act of publishing a Blueprint definition makes that Blueprint available to be assigned to a subscription by creating a unique version of your Blueprint definition.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is not currently possible to create a managed domain name with a prefix that exceeds 15 characters.  More information can be found on this topic, in this article:  
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-create-instance

## Prerequisites

1. **An [Azure tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/education/deploy/intro-azure-active-directory#what-is-an-azure-ad-tenant)**. In this Blueprint by default, a new instance of Azure Active Directory Domain Services is created.  Though not a hard requirement, it is recommended that the domain name you specify is the same as your Azure Active Directory "Primary domain" name.  Though you can create a long tenant domain name prefix, you cannot in AAD DS, therefore it is recommended to have your domain name prefix 15 characters or less.  
In the case of an existing domain, this Blueprint can still be utilized.  There are instructions in this guide in the **"Tips"** section on this topic.

1. **An [Azure Global Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference) account**  
An Azure Global administrator account is required to successfully assign (deploy) the Azure AVD Blueprints.

1. **An [Azure Managed Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview)**  
The Azure Managed Identity exists within Azure and can securely store and retrieve credentials from Azure Key Vault during the deployment. There are two types of Azure Managed Identies: 'System Assigned' and 'User Assigned'. For the purpose of this AVD Blueprint, the type 'User Assigned Managed Identity' will be utilized.  The instructions for creating a managed identity are here: **[Create a user-assigned managed identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-portal#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity)**  

    **NOTE:** In the case of “greenfield” deployments, the level of assignment will need to be the Azure subscription.  The AVD Blueprint, by default, creates objects at the subscription level during the blueprint deployment such as Azure AD DS.  

1. **Security configuration in the environment for a Blueprint Operator**  
The management of Blueprint definitions and Blueprint assignments are two different roles, thus the need for two different identities. A blueprint definition can use either system-assigned or user-assigned managed identities. However, when using the **Blueprint Operator** role, the blueprint definition needs to be configured to use a ***user-assigned managed identity***. Additionally, the account or security group being granted the Blueprint Operator role needs to be granted the Managed Identity Operator role on the user-assigned managed identity. Without this permission, blueprint assignments fail because of lack of permissions.  

    The high-level configuration steps are as follows (documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/blueprints/how-to/configure-for-blueprint-operator)):  

    * [Create an Azure security group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal) (example: **Blueprint Operators**)  
    * At the subscription level, assign roles to the group previously created, by going to the following location in the Azure Portal  
    > **Azure Portal** -> **Home** -> **Subscriptions** -> (***your subscription***) -> **Access Control (IAM)**  
    * [Add the managed identity created in Step 2 of this document, and the Global Administrator accounts to the Azure security group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal#create-a-basic-group-and-add-members)  
    * Assign permissions to the group, to allow members to create objects at the subscription level:

        * [Blueprint Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#blueprint-contributor)
        * [Blueprint Operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#blueprint-operator)
        * [Managed Identity Operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#managed-identity-operator)  

    When correctly configured, the Role assignments for your Azure AD group, should look like this:  

    ![Blueprint Group Access Control Depiction](https://github.com/Azure/AVDBlueprint/blob/main/images/BluePrint_GroupAccessControlDepiction.PNG)

1. **An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) with sufficient credits to deploy the environment, and keep it running at the desired levels**  

1. **Azure Blueprint resource provider registered to your subscription** through Azure PowerShell with this PowerShell command:  

    ```PowerShell
    Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Blueprint
    ```

    You should receive this output from the Register-AzResourceProvider command:  

    ```ProviderNamespace   Microsoft.Blueprint  
    RegistrationState : Registering  
    ResourceTypes     : {blueprints, blueprints/artifacts, blueprints/versions, blueprints/versions/artifacts…}  
    Locations         : {}  
    ```

1. **Azure Active Directory provider registered to your subscription** (if not already registered):  
Check the current provider registration status in your subscription:  

    ```powershell
    Get-AzResourceProvider -ListAvailable | Select-Object ProviderNamespace, RegistrationState
    ```

    If necessary, register the Azure AD resource provider:

    ```powershell
    Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.AAD
    ```

1. **Azure Active Directory Domain Services Enterprise application registered to your subscription**

    Documentation: [Create an Azure Active Directory Domain Services managed domain using an Azure Resource Manager template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-domain-services/template-create-instance)

    Run the following PowerShell command:

    ```powershell
    New-AzureADServicePrincipal -AppId "6ba9a5d4-8456-4118-b521-9c5ca10cdf84"
    ```

1. **[Domain Controller Services service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal)** (if it does not already exist), with this PowerShell command

    ```powershell
    New-AzureADServicePrincipal -AppId "2565bd9d-da50-47d4-8b85-4c97f669dc36"
    ```  

1. **Managed identity assigned the Owner role at the subscription level**  
The reason is that the managed identity needs full access during the deployment, for example to initiate the creation of an instance of Azure AD DS.  

    **MORE INFO:** [Add or change Azure subscription administrators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/add-change-subscription-administrator)  

1. **The account used to assign the Blueprint, granted "User Access Administrator" at the subscription level**  
The account used to manage the subscription and later assign the Blueprint, should be assigned the "User Access Administrator". During Blueprint assignment users are going to be created and assigned to a AVD group. The "User Access Administrator" permission ensures the requisite permission in Azure AD to perform this function.  

    **MORE INFO:** [Assign a user as an administrator of an Azure subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal-subscription-admin)  

1. **The Blueprint main file (Blueprint.json), and related artifact objects**  
These objects are publicly available on Github.com. Once the Blueprint objects have been acquired, they need to be customized to each respective environment. The necessary customizations can be applied in a few different ways.

## Import, Publish and Assign the Blueprint

1. Import the Blueprint - <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/blueprints/how-to/import-export-ps>
2. Publish the Blueprint - <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/blueprints/create-blueprint-portal>
3. Assign the Blueprint - <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/blueprints/create-blueprint-portal>

**NOTE:** The following three sections are example methods available to assign the AVD Blueprint.  There are sample assignment files in the Github repository in the 'Examples & Samples' folder.

### Manage the Blueprint using Azure Cloud Shell

Azure hosts Azure Cloud Shell, an interactive shell environment that can be used through a web browser.
You can use either Bash or PowerShell with Cloud Shell to work with Azure services.
You can use the Cloud Shell preinstalled commands to import and assign the AVD Blueprint without having to install anything on your local environment.  
There are several ways to get started with Azure Cloud Shell:  

1. Start Azure CloudShell:  

    * **Direct link**: Open a browser to [https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com).

    * **Azure portal**: Select the Cloud Shell icon on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com):

      ![Icon to launch the Cloud Shell from the Azure portal](./images/portal-launch-icon.png)

1. Start PowerShell in Azure CloudShell ([more information here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview#choice-of-preferred-shell-experience))

1. Run the following command to clone the Azure AVDBlueprint repository to CloudDrive.  

    ```dos
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/AVDBlueprint.git $HOME/clouddrive/AVDBlueprint
    ```

    **TIP:**  Run ```dir $HOME/clouddrive``` to verify the repository was successfully cloned to your CloudDrive  

1. Run the following commands to import the required PowerShell modules needed to import the blueprint (if not previously installed)

    ```PowerShell
    Install-Module -Name Az.Blueprint
    Import-Module Az.Blueprint
    ```

1. Run the following command to import the AVD Blueprint definition, and save it within the specified subscription or management group.  

    ```powershell
    Import-AzBlueprintWithArtifact -Name "YourBlueprintName" -SubscriptionId "00000000-1111-0000-1111-000000000000" -InputPath "$HOME/clouddrive/AVDBlueprint/blueprint"
    ```  

    **NOTE:** The '-InputPath' argument must point to the folder where blueprint.json file is placed.

1. From the Azure Portal, browse to [Azure Blueprint service tab](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/BlueprintsMenuBlade/GetStarted) and select "**Blueprint definitions**".  
You can review newly imported Blueprint definitions and follow instructions to edit, publish and assign blueprint. ([More information](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/blueprints/create-blueprint-portal#edit-a-blueprint))  

### Manage the Blueprint using local storage on a device and publish in Azure portal (Windows instructions)  

You can manage the AVD Blueprint using a device that has a small amount of local storage available.

1. Go the [AVD Blueprint Github repository main folder](https://github.com/Azure/AVDBlueprint).  

1. Click or tap the down arrow on the green button called 'Code', then tap or click the option 'Download Zip'.  

      ![Image for Github Download Zip option](./images/GitDownloadZip2.png)  

1. Once the .zip file is downloaded to your local device, you can expand the contents to any location of your choosing,
by double-clicking the downloaded .zip file, and then copying the main folder within the zip to any location, such as 'C:\AVDBlueprint-main'.  

1. The next step is to import the Blueprint to your Azure subscription. These are the high-level steps to import the Blueprint:

    * Start PowerShell.
    * Run the following PowerShell commands to import the required modules needed to import the blueprint (if not previously installed)

    ```PowerShell
    Install-Module -Name Az.Blueprint
    Import-Module Az.Blueprint
    ```  

    **NOTE:** Installing the PowerShell 'Az' modules does not include the Az.Blueprint modules. If you have installed the 'Az' modules, you will still need to install the Az.Blueprint modules.  

1. Authenticate to your subscription by using the following PowerShell command

    ```powershell
    Connect-AzAccount
    ```

1. Run the following command to import the Blueprint to your Azure subscription:  

    ```powershell
    Import-AzBlueprintWithArtifact -Name "YourBlueprintName" -SubscriptionId "00000000-1111-0000-1111-000000000000" -InputPath 'C:\AVDBlueprint-main\Blueprint'
    ```

1. From the Azure Portal, browse to [Azure Blueprint service tab](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Policy/BlueprintsMenuBlade/GetStarted) and select "**Blueprint definitions**".  
You can review newly imported Blueprint definitions and follow instructions to edit, publish and assign blueprint. ([More information](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/blueprints/create-blueprint-portal#edit-a-blueprint))  

### Manage the Blueprint using a local repository of Blueprint files and customized files to import and assign using PowerShell (Windows device)

This method performs all activities on the local machine.  This example uses Visual Studio Code.  You can use Visual Studio code as the one-stop development and deployment toolset.  Several extensions make working with ARM templates a little easier:

1. Install Visual Studio Code (the following extensions are recommended):
    * GitLens--Git supercharged
    * PowerShell
    * Azure CLI Tools
    * Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Tools
1. Go the [AVD Blueprint Github repository main folder](https://github.com/Azure/AVDBlueprint) in your favorite web browser

1. Click or tap the down arrow on the green button called 'Code', then tap or click the option 'Download Zip'.  

      ![Image for Github Download Zip option](./images/GitDownloadZip2.png)

1. Once the .zip file is downloaded to your local device, you can expand the contents to any location of your choosing,
by double-clicking the downloaded .zip file, and then copying the main folder within the zip to any location.
        The example files in this repository use this path:

    > C:\VSCode\AVDBlueprint
        You can put the files from the "Samples & Examples" folder in the following location (as an example)  
        **C:\VSCode\CustomizedFiles**  
        That way if you customize your files but decide to reinitialize your local repository, your customized files remain unchanged.  

## Teardown

If an environment built by this blueprint is no longer needed, a script is provided in the Resources folder that will export logs found in an AVD Blueprint deployment's Log Analytics Workspace to a csv file stored in the directory specified at runtime.  

The script finds and removes the following items that were previously deployed via AVD Blueprint:

* All SessionHosts and HostPools in a ResourceGroup based on resource prefix
* All users discovered in 'AVD Users' group
* 'AVD Users' group itself
* 'AAD DC Admins' group

Use of `-verbose`, `-whatif` or `-comfirm` ARE supported. Also, the script will create one Powershell Job for each Resource Group being removed. Teardowns typically take quite some time, so this will allow you to return to prompt and keep working while the job runs in the background.  

**Example:**

```powershell
#Exports logs of a AVD Blueprint deployment that used the prefix "ABC" followed by a removal:
.\Remove-AzAvdBpDeployment.ps1 -Verbose -Prefix "ABC" -LogPath "C:\projects"

#Use help for more details or examples:  
help .\Remove-AzAvdBpDeployment.ps1
```

## Tips

### Preexisting Active Directory

If there is already an active Active Directory environment in the target environment, it is possible to have this blueprint integrate with that rather than deploy a new one. Two actions need to be taken to support this:

1. Delete the adds.json artifact from the Artifacts folder
2. Remove all "adds" entries from the "dependsOn" section of the following artifacts:
    * addsDAUser.json
    * avdDeploy.json
    * DNSsharedSvcs.json
    * mgmtvm.json

### Group Policy Settings

Regarding Group Policy settings that are applied to the AVD session host computers, during the Blueprint deployment. There are two
sections of Group Policy settings applied to the AVD session hosts:  

* **FSLogix settings**
* **Session Host RDP lockdown settings**  

#### FSLogix Settings

The FSLogix Windows policy settings are the mechanism used to enable the FSLogix profile management solution.  This Blueprint currently utilizes Azure Files as the FSLogix profile container storage location.  These settings are documented in [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/fslogix/configure-profile-container-tutorial).

During Blueprint deployment, some of the parameters are evaluated and used to create a variable for the FSLogix profile share UNC path, as it exits in each unique deployment.  The parameter is then written to a new Group Policy Object that is applied to the Active Directory Organizational Unit that is created by the script run from the management VM, for the AVD session host VMs.  Here is the complete list of FSLogix settings applied by this Blueprint:

> VHDLocation == {unique UNC path for each deployment}  
> Enabled == Yes  
> DeleteLocalProfileWhenVHDShouldApply == Enabled  
> FlipFlopProfileDirectoryName == Enabled  

#### Remote Desktop Session Host redirection settings

This Blueprint adds as a default, one RDP redirection setting:

> "fEnableTimeZoneRedirection"

 There are several Windows policy settings that control certain aspects of the user experience while connected to a session host. The **"Remote Desktop Session Host redirection"** settings are set in the script,  **'CreateAADDSFileShare_ConfigureGP.ps1'**.  This script is run from the "management VM" in the "MGMTVM" artifact.  If you wish to add additional redirection settings, the best way may be to 



  There is one setting that is not available in that file, which is a Group Policy start script entry, for a script that is downloaded and run by each AVD session host, on their next Startup ***after they have received and applied their new group policy***.  Here is the workflow of the chain of events that lead up to the session hosts becoming fully functional.

1. AVD session host VMs are created, and joined to the AAD DS domain.  This happens in the artifact **"AVDDeploy.json"**.
2. Later the "management VM" is created, and joined to the domain.  This domain join triggers a reboot, and the JoinDomain extension waits for the machine to reboot and check in before the "MGMTVM" artifact continues.
3. After the management VM reboots, the next section of "MGMTVM" artifact initiates running a custom script, which is downloaded from Azure storage, to the management VM.
4. The Management VM runs the **'CreateAADDSFileShare_ConfigureGP.ps1'** script, which has two sections: 1) Create storage for FSLogix, 2) Run the domain management code
5. The domain management code does the following for the session hosts:
    1. Creates a new GPO called **"AVD Session Host policy"**
    2. Creates a new OU called **"AVD Computers"**
    3. Links the AVD GPO to the AVD OU
    4. Restores a previous GP export, which imports a Startup script to the new GPO Startup folder
    5. Moves only the AVD session host computer objects to the new AVD OU
    6. Invokes a command to each VM in the AVD OU, to immediately refresh Group Policy
    7. Invokes a command to each VM in the AVD OU, to reboot with a 5 second delay
    8. On restart, the AVD VMs will run the Virtual Desktop Optimization Tool available from Github.com.

Now for the tip.  If there is a particular setting that you do not want to apply, you could download a copy of the script **'Create-AzAADDSJoinedFileshare.ps1'**.  Then you can customize the script file by editing out the line that applies a particular group policy setting that you may not want to apply to the AVD sessions host.  An example will be listed just below.  
So that the AVD session hosts can be customized to your environment, you would then create an Azure storage container, set to anonymous access, then upload your script to that location.  
Lastly, you would edit the Blueprint artifact file "MGMTVM", currently line 413.  But that section looks like this:

```json
"properties": {
    "publisher": "Microsoft.Compute",
    "type": "CustomScriptExtension",
    "typeHandlerVersion": "1.7",
    "autoUpgradeMinorVersion": true,
    "settings": {
        "fileUris": [
            "https://contosoblueprints.blob.core.windows.net/blueprintscripts/Create-AzAADDSJoinedFileshare.ps1" 
```

You would edit the value inside the quotes, to point to your specific storage location.  For example, you might change yours to something like this:

```json
"properties": {
    "publisher": "Microsoft.Compute",
    "type": "CustomScriptExtension",
    "typeHandlerVersion": "1.7",
    "autoUpgradeMinorVersion": true,
    "settings": {
    "settings":{
        "fileUris": [
            "https://myazureaccount.blob.core.windows.net/blueprintscripts/Create-AzAADDSJoinedFileshare.ps1"
```

Lastly, you would edit the script **'Create-AzAADDSJoinedFileshare.ps1'** to remove the setting you are interested in.  Here are the settings details:  

#### Session Host RDP lockdown settings  

```powershell
Set-GPRegistryValue -Name "AVD Session Host Policy" -Key "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services" -Type DWORD -ValueName "fDisableAudioCapture" -Value 1

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a Microsoft provided suite available for editing, importing, and assigning the Blueprints. If using VS Code, the following extensions will greatly assist the efforts:|

  * Azure Resource Manager Tools  
  * XML Formatter  
  * PowerShell extension (so that all work can be performed within one tool)  

   There may be other extensions available that perform the same functionality

* To store scripts and any other objects needed during Blueprint assignment on Internet connected assignments, a public web location can be used to store scripts and other objects needed during Blueprint assignment.  
[Azure Storage Blob](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/) is one possible method to make the scripts and other objects available.
Whatever method chosen, the access method should be "public" and "anonymous" read-only access.
Another method that could be used to access scripts is a "fork" from the Azure AVD Blueprint repository.  You can fork to your Github repository, then edit the scripts or Blueprint files if needed, then change the parameter "_ScriptURI" to your location.
For example, I created a fork of the Azure AVD Blueprint repository to my personal repository at "https://github.com/robsmi-msfte/AVDBlueprint".  To get the value for "_ScriptURI", click the scripts folder, then click one of the scripts.  To the right, click the button called "Raw".  Then, copy the URL from your web browser, up to the word "scripts", but don't include the trailing slash.  For example, here would be my "_ScriptURI":

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robsmi-msfte/AVDBlueprint/main/scripts

You can then set this value in either your Blueprint file, but preferably in a Blueprint Assignment file.  An Assignment file is a JSON file that is used to set specific parameter values and pass those values to the Blueprint and the Blueprint artifacts.  Here is a small example of a Blueprint Assignment file:
```JSON
{  
    "name": "AVD Blueprint - Default Configuration",  
    "type": "Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprintAssignments",
    "apiVersion": "2018-11-01-preview",
    "location": "centralus",
    "identity": {
        "type": "UserAssigned",
        "userAssignedIdentities": {
            "/subscriptions/291bba3f-e0a5-47bc-a099-3bdcb2a50a05/resourcegroups/AVD-Blueprint-RG/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/UAI1" : {}
        }
    },
    "properties": {
      "displayName": "AVD Blueprint - Full Deployment (Default)",
      "description": "Deploys a default Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) deployment with all dependencies.",
      "blueprintId": "/subscriptions/291bba3f-e0a5-47bc-a099-3bdcb2a50a05/providers/Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprints/AVDBlueprint",
      "scope": "/subscriptions/291bba3f-e0a5-47bc-a099-3bdcb2a50a05",
      "parameters": {
        "resourcePrefix": {
            "value": "AVD001"
        },
        "_ScriptURI": {
          "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/AVDBlueprint/main/scripts",
          "description": "The URL to the script folder available during Blueprint assignment."
}
```

More information about using Blueprint Assignment files can be found at the following location:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/blueprints/how-to/manage-assignments-ps

* If you need to delete a deployment with the intent of starting over with a new deployment, you will need to change the "Deployment Prefix" value in the "assign_default.json" file.
  This file is used to prefix most of the Azure resources created during the deployment, including a [Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/) object.
  Azure Key Vault is used to store and retrieve cryptographic keys used by cloud apps and services, and as such is treated with great care in Azure.
  When an Azure Key Vault is deleted, it transitions to a "soft delete" state for a period of time, before actually being deleted.
  While an Azure Key Vault is in soft delete state, another key vault cannot be created with the same name.  Therefore, if you do not change your
  Resource Prefix value for subsequent deployments, the subsequent deployments will fail with an error referencing Key Vault name.
  
* Create a Resource Group for your Blueprint resources
During the Blueprint deployment process, you will be creating some resources that you may want to retain after the blueprint has been deployed.
Depending on various factors, you may create a managed identity, a storage blob, etc. To that end, you could create a resource group, and in that resource group you only create items that are related to your Blueprint work. Another reason for this is that you can build and deconstruct a Blueprint, over and over, yet retain some of the core objects necessary, which will save time and effort.  

    Example: AVDBlueprint-RG

* Development and/or Production environments can be used to work with the Blueprint code
Development environments are well suited to streamlining workflows such as [“import”](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/blueprints/how-to/import-export-ps) and [“assign”](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/blueprints/how-to/manage-assignments-ps) the Blueprints.
PowerShell or CloudShell can be utilized for various tasks. If using PowerShell, you may need to import the [Az.Blueprint module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/blueprints/how-to/manage-assignments-ps#add-the-azblueprint-module) for PowerShell.

### Sovereign Clouds

To deploy this blueprint into Azure sovereign clouds, two steps are necessary:

1. Edits to CreateAADDSFileshare_ConfigureGP.ps1
2. Change **Location** fields in the assignment file

#### Edits to CreateAADDSFileshare_ConfigureGP.ps1

##### Connect-AzAccount

Amend all references to `Connect-AzAccount` in CreateAADDSFileshare_ConfigureGP.ps1 with the appropriate `-EnvironmentName` argument. A complete list of environments may be obtained using the [`Get-AzEnvironment`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.accounts/get-azenvironment?view=azps-6.2.1) cmdlet in Powershell.

For example, to use the Azure US Government sovereign cloud, the `Connect-AzAccount` cmdlet would look like:

```powershell
Connect-AzAccount -Identity -Environment 'AzureUSGovernment'
```


##### $StorageFQDN

The storage fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in Azure Commercial is "file.core.windows.net".  In Azure Gov, that FQDN is "file.core.usgovcloudapi.net".  There are two places in the script the FQDN is referenced.  The easiest method is find and replace "file.core.windows.net" with "file.core.usgovcloudapi.net".

#### Location Fields In The Assignment File

The location field for the assignment file itself should reflect a region in the sovereign cloud relevant to the deployment...

```json
{
    "name": "AVD Blueprint - Default Configuration",
    "type": "Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprintAssignments",
    "apiVersion": "2018-11-01-preview",
    "location": "**regionname**",
    "identity": {
        "type": "UserAssigned",
```

...as well as the ResourceGroup location defined further down in the assignment file:

```json
      "resourceGroups": {
        "ResourceGroup": {
          "location": "**regionname**"
        }
      }
```

## Change List

* Added examples and samples. Recents updates to the AVD Blueprint mean that the Blueprint files themselves, no longer need any manual edits. And you can use the same Blueprint files for Azure Commercial or Azure US Government.  For your unique values, such as SubscriptionID and so on, you can use an "Assignment" file, which is JSON language, and a sample is now included in the "Examples and Samples" folder

* Edited the two sample PowerShell scripts that perform the Import, Publish, and Assignment tasks.  The script named "assign-bp.ps1" performs the import and publish functions.  The file "assign-bp.ps1" performs the Blueprint assignment.  These two example files can be used as-is, without modification.  Of the remaining two files; "run.config.json" and "assign_default.json" samples, the "run.config.json" would most likely only be edited once, to include your unique values of TenantID and SubscriptionID.  The remaining file "assign_default.json" is the only file you need edit afterward to customize the Blueprint experience.  There is a new section in the section of this Readme called **Manage the Blueprint using a local repository of Blueprint files and customized files to import and assign using PowerShell (Windows device)**.

* 08/10/2021: Streamlined Log Analytics by removing log collection for components not in use by this Blueprint.  Also, updated the API version for several resources with the Log Analytics artifact, for compatibility across several clouds.

* 08/10/2021: Updated the list of Azure VM sizes in the "AllowedValues" list in the "avdHostPool_vmGalleryImageSKU" parameter.  Based on what is available as of 08/18/21, from "19h2" to "21h1", with and without Office 365.

* 08/10/2021: Edited Blueprint parameter "AzureEnvironmentName" to included allowed values for AzureCloud and AzureUSGovernment.  The default value is AzureCloud.  You can override that value with an Assignment file.

* 08/10/2021: Edited Blueprint parameter "AzureStorageFQDN" to include the storage endpoints for both Azure Commercial and Azure Government.  The default value is Azure Commercial (file.core.windows.net)
